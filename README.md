# Student-Grant-System
**Who our users are:**
Students applying for financial aid and grants

Parents/guardians who help provide financial information, review awards, and make funding decisions

**The problem we’re solving**
Students and parents often complete the FAFSA correctly but still run into system downtime, delayed processing, confusing error messages, and late financial aid decisions.

Because of these delays, families can’t plan tuition, housing, or other college costs in time. This creates stress, uncertainty, and can even affect enrollment or retention.

Our goal is to modernize the student grant process with a simple, reliable system where students and parents can apply, quickly see eligibility, and receive timely, transparent decisions.

**Main outcomes / success criteria:**
Students can submit a grant application without errors or confusion

Eligibility is automatically checked and processed quickly

Students can clearly track their application status

Decisions (approved/denied) are delivered on time

Students receive notifications and next steps immediately

Administrators can easily manage grants and review applications
